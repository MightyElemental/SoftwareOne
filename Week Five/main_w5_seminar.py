# WEEK 5 - SEMINAR 2

# ---- Exercise 1 ----
'''
Given list A of n numbers, find the largest possible sum of a contiguous sub-list.

[ -2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4 ]

For example, for the list given above, the contiguous sub-list with the largest sum is
[4, -1, 2, 1], with sum 6 (in red).

--==Brute force approach==--
One obvious solution is to calculate the sum of every possible sub-list and the maximum of
those would be the solution. We can start from index 0 and calculate the sum of every possible
sub-list starting with the element A[0]. Then, we would calculate the sum of every possible
sub-list starting with A[1], A[2] and so on up to A[n-1], where n denotes the size of the list.
Note that every single element is a sub-list itself.
Using the pseudo code notation shown in Seminar 1, write the brute force algorithm to solve
the problem. Given a list of size n, how many comparisons are done?

# Answer
# This is extremely inefficient method. I believe it has a time complexity classification of O(n^2)

--==Could you think of a better approach?==--
This is quite difficult, and a better approach will be explained during the seminar session. But
it does not hurt to have a thought about it beforehand.

# Probably use start and end pointers. Not sure how that would work since they'd need to look forward to the end which could use a lot of processing.


# ---- Exercise 2 ----
'''
Given a matrix (2D list) A[0. . n âˆ’ 1, 0. . m âˆ’ 1] of numbers, find the largest possible sum of a
rectangle submatrix. The top-left element in the matrix is A[0][0], and the element A[r][c] is
the element at row r, column c.

For example, for the matrix given above, the rectangle with the largest sum is highlighted in
red with sum 17.
